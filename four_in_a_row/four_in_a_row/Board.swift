// NSCoding is used to encoding and decode objects so that they can be archived, such as when you're writing to UserDefaults. This is good for when you want to save or distribute your data, but it's not very efficient if you just want to copy it.
// NSCopying: it's a protocol that lets iOS take a copy of your object in memory, with the copy being identical but separate to the original. This is needed since GameplayKit will be taking a lot of copies of our game board.
