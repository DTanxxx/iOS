// Three protocols required for GameplayKit AI to work:
// 1.GKGameModel: represents the state of play, which means it needs to know where all the game pieces are, who the players are, what happens after each move is made, and what the score for a player is given any state.
// 2. GKGameModelPlayer (conformed to by Player class): represents one player in the game, which means it needs your player class to have a playerId integer. It's used to identify a player uniquely inside the AI.
// 3. GKGameModelUpdate (conformed to by Move class): represents one possible move in the game. For us, that means storing a column number to represent a piece being played there. This protocol requires that you also store a value integer, which is used to rank all possible results by quality to help GameplayKit make a good choice.

// How the AI actually works:
// When you ask GameplayKit to find a move, it will examine all possible moves. To begin with, that is every column, because they all have space for moves in them. It then takes a copy of the game, and makes a virtual move on that copy. It then takes a copy of the game, and makes a different virtual move, and so on until until all initial first moves have been made.
// Next, it starts to re-use its copies to save on memory: it will take one of those copies and apply a game state to it, which means it will reset the board so that it matches the position after one of its virtual moves. It will then rinse and repeat: it will examine all possible moves, and make one. It does this for all moves, and does so recursively until it has created a tree of all possible moves and outcomes, or at least as many as you ask it to scan.
// Each time the AI has made a move, it will ask us what the player score is.
// Hence the reason why we have two separate models (classes) of nearly identical content (Board and ViewController classes) is because that the AI already needs to calculate a lot of moves for it to work (7x7x7x7x... in this case, because there are 7 columns). If we have the AI to work on the ViewController class as a whole (instead of a concise, separate Board class), every time it makes a copy of the model to simulate one move it will have to copy additional objects (the UIViews for chips in this case) that are unnecessary, which will slow down the AI.
// To sum things up: To simulate a move, GameplayKit takes copies of our board state, finds all possible moves that can happen, and applies them all on different copies.
